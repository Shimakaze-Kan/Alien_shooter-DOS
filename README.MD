## How to play
Your task is to stop an alien invasion by shooting at the UFO.\
The arrows are used to control your character (you can press 2 at the same time).\
X on the keyboard is used to shoot (UFO can shoot too).\
You must avoid ufo bullets as well as the spaceship itself.

That's basically it.

## Additional info
This game was made quickly just for fun and this is my first game for MS-DOS. The code is spaghetti-code, dirty and full of bad practices.
